# Dash - Construction risk level Dashboard

## Introduction to Dash
- Downloaded 600,000 times per month, Dash is the original low-code framework for rapidly building data apps in Python, R, Julia, and F# (experimental).

- Written on top of Plotly.js and React.js, Dash is ideal for building and deploying data apps with customized user interfaces. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data.

- Through a couple of simple patterns, Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols that are required to build a full-stack web app with interactive data visualization.

- Dash is simple enough that you can bind a user interface to your code in less than 10 minutes.

- Dash apps are rendered in the web browser. You can deploy your apps to VMs or Kubernetes clusters and then share them through URLs. Since Dash apps are viewed in the web browser, Dash is inherently cross-platform and mobile ready.

## About Data
We have 1897 record about acciedent happen in construction sites with featuers like type of this accident , Division, risk level, Date,...etc
